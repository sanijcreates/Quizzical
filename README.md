# Quizzical
This is a React.js project. The main motive of this project was to practise API integration. It is a simple quiz game where you can test you knowledge about computers.

I have used the Open Trivia Database API(https://opentdb.com/) in this project. I plan to make this project more dynamic by letting users choose the different fields of 
questions. Right now, it only shows questions related to Computer Science. There are still few bugs that I will be fixing in the future.
